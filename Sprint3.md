###### Sprint 3 Unit Tests
- AssignmentController -> Mocking assignmentService
  tests the controller functions like getAssignments, getAssignment etc while integrated with the mocked service.
- SubmissionController -> Mocking submissionService
  tests the controller functions like getsubmission, getSubmittedfiles etc while integrated with the mocked service.
- AssignmentService -> Mocking assignmentRepository, userRepository
