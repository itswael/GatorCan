#### **‚úÖ Unit Tests and Functional Tests for Backend (Muthu & Mohammad)**
##### **Unit Tests:**
###### Sprint 3 Unit Tests
- courseController -> Mocking courseService
    tests the controller functions like getCourse, getEnrolledCourse etc while integrated with the mocked service.
- userController -> Mocking userService
    tests the controller functions like getUserDetails, login, updateUserDetails etc while integrated with the mocked service.
- userService -> Mocking userRepository, courseRepository
    tests the user service functions for implemented business logic for the functions like getUserDetails, login, updateUserDetails etc while integrated with the mocked reporsitories.
- courseService -> Mocking userRepository, courseRepository
    tests the course service functions for implemented business logic for the functions like getCourse, getEnrolledCourse etc while integrated with the mocked reporsitories.
- AssignmentController -> Mocking assignmentService
    tests the controller functions like getAssignments, getAssignment etc while integrated with the mocked service.
- SubmissionController -> Mocking submissionService
    tests the controller functions like getsubmission, getSubmittedfiles etc while integrated with the mocked service.
- AssignmentService -> Mocking assignmentRepository, userRepository
    tests the user service functions for implemented business logic for the functions like getAssignments, getAssignment etc while integrated with the mocked reporsitories.
- SubmissionService -> Mocking submissionRepository, userRepository
    tests the user service functions for implemented business logic for the functions like getsubmission, getSubmittedfiles etc while integrated with the mocked reporsitories.

###### Sprint 4 Unit Tests
- NotificationService -> Mocking SNS Client
- RecommendationService -> Mocking Course Repository, tests the recommendation functionality to get the recommended course  based on different user course history.
- RecommendationService Controller -> Mocking RecommendationService, tests the recommendation functionality to get the recommended course based on different user course history.
- SummarizationService -> Mocking NLP summarization logic, to generate the summary of the text content passed in the body parameter with one third length of the original content.

##### **Functional Tests:**
- Fetch assignments
- Submit assignments
- Grade assignments
- Role-based access testing
- Authentication & authorization testing
- New assignment notification trigger
- Assignment graded notification trigger
